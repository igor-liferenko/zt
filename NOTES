in original ftmod_zt.c ioctl with "ztcfg" message will never work, because it is done on /dev/dahdi/channel - this ioctl only works on /dev/dahdi/ctl

dahdi_cfg always does "ioctl(chanfd, DAHDI_HDLC_RATE, &rate), rate=64" (independent of config), so
if something will not work, try to do it in dahdi-chan.w
